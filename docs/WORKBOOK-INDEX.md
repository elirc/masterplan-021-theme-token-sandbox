# M021: expanded learning workshop

[Expanded workshop map](WORKBOOK-INDEX.md) · [Repository overview](../README.md)

This second learning edition extends the original companion. The working implementation is unchanged. The original six stories plus nine new stories give you **15 unfinished practice stories**. The new chapters add guided reconstruction, explicit test design, worked debugging routes, decision reviews and repeated recall. None of the proposed features is silently claimed as implemented.

## Choose a route instead of reading everything first

If syntax still feels unfamiliar, begin with the foundations clinic and one ordinary trace. If you can explain the reference, choose one story and consult only the relevant sections. If you already implemented a variation, use the test-design and review workshops to challenge it. The aim is increasing independence, not completing a reading quota.

**Current learning target:** CSS tokens and consistency. Pair this with existing curriculum #28, [Sprint-Challenge--Advanced-CSS](https://github.com/elirc/Sprint-Challenge--Advanced-CSS). The broader MASTERPLAN checkpoint is #28.

## What to keep saying in your own words

A theme should resolve to a complete set of roles before it is applied. Applying only overrides can leave values from the previous theme behind. Shared spacing and color roles let two components change coherently, while contrast arithmetic checks only the particular color pairs supplied. Inspect computed styles to connect data to actual rendering.

## All fifteen stories

Stories 01–06 remain in [the original practice chapter](05-PRACTICE-STORIES.md), now with added planning checkpoints. Stories 07–15 are in [the new implementation workshops](11-NINE-MORE-STORIES.md). Each includes a bounded plan, acceptance evidence, a choice for you to make, a review route and a saved coaching prompt.

## How repetition is used

The same important idea reappears as a definition, a concrete prediction, a failure diagnosis, a feature decision and a later recall question. Those are different tasks. Do not count rereading the same sentence five times as five successful retrieval attempts. Close the explanation, change one input or condition, and produce a new answer before checking it.

Work in short sessions and leave a specific next action in your journal. A useful stopping point might be one explained trace, one confirmed hypothesis or one reviewed acceptance example. You do not need to implement every optional extension before progressing to the next project.

## Evidence labels

The existing verification record describes checks actually run against the reference. New casebook incidents are hypothetical training scenarios. Saved prompts are instructions for future use, not records of assistant conversations that already happened. Journal fields are blank on purpose. Distinguish reference evidence, your current observation and a proposed experiment whenever you write about the project.
